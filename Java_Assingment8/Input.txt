Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Nicknamed "the Red Devils", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.Manchester United are the most successful club in England, having won a record 20 League Titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. The club has also won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.[3] In 2016–17, they also, by winning the UEFA Europa League, became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions. In winning all three top domestic trophies (as well as both iterations of the English championship), all three major European trophies, both the domestic and European super cups, and being the only British club to have won both international titles (the now-defunct Intercontinental Cup in 1999 and its successor, the FIFA World Club Cup in 2008), the club has achieved a clean sweep of all top honours available to it; the first and only English club to do so.[4] The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013,[5][6][7] when he announced his retirement. José Mourinho is the club's current manager, having been appointed on 27 May 2016. Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2015–16, with an annual revenue of €689 million,[8] and the world's most valuable football club in 2017, valued at £2.86 billion.[9] As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2 billion.[10][11] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again, before going public once more in August 2012, when they made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.
